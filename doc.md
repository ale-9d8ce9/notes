.h / .v classes are to determine if something like a list is horizontal or vertical

.hover-list is the class where the ::after follows the cursor and takes the shape of the hovered element (like in #tools or #statusbar)
.select-list is the class where the hovered element chages its background element (like in font selection popup or text alignment popup)
